This example showcases a common, yet subtle issue in Ruby: directly manipulating instance variables outside of defined methods.  While technically possible using `instance_variable_set` and `instance_variable_get`, this practice often leads to unexpected behavior and makes code less maintainable.

The `bug.rb` file demonstrates the issue, where the instance variable `@value` is changed without using the defined `value` method. This can create inconsistencies and make it harder to track changes to the object's state.

The `bugSolution.rb` offers a better approach: encapsulating the modification of instance variables within the class methods. This enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier to reason about and debug the program's behavior.
